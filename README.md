# Scrum_Method

This repo isn't a project but rather a demonstration of different processes involved in the Scrum agile development method. Such as gathering user stories and converting them into functional and non-functional requirements. Also mapping a plan for development using a Gantt Chart. 
On the other file, it involves completing various types of UML diagrams such as use, class, sequence, and activity.
